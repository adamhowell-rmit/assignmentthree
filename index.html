								<br>	
								<p>Born in 1984, I grew up around the early computers (amiga) and gaming consoles (Sega, Nes Etc) But as I’ve gotten older my interests have become more varied, I enjoy DIY projects around my home and working on my old car on the side. I only got my car license in 2016 aged 32, prior to that I cycled everywhere until getting a motorbike license at age 27. I was involved in an accident that broke my left Tibia (bone below the knee) and dislocated my right hip. The recovery was slow but considering the extent of the injuries I have recovered well. I don't get to play as much these days, and no longer own any consoles apart from my original NES. Here are my wife and I’s 2 cats, Fluffy and QT. They are brothers, and very pampered. I enclosed our entire property for them to be able to go outside but not get into any trouble.

I’ve played a lot of video games in my teens, and I hope to have a career in software development and eventually management. I’m interested in development and development management because of how tangible the problems are, and how effectual solving them can be. IT in general is a field of solution pursuit and I find that appealing. My Ideal job was an engineer in AWS’s quickstep team. Which is responsible for building “Quickstep”, a high-performance caching server, for amazons CloudFront. They are looking for applicants comfortable with agile, large-scale systems, web design, a modern programming language like rust, C/C++ or c#, and architecture/design.

								<br>
								<p>Hello there! My name is Adam Howell and I am currently studying Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open University Australia, working in Group #40 called “Unicorn”. A little history about me, I'm a certified mechanic and had worked in the field for close to nine years. I decided to step away from that role and enter an industry of something I've also been passionate about, the world of I.T! I grew up playing video games from a very young age, my father brought home a PlayStation One with his first paycheck from his new job when I was around 5 years old. I grew up playing a variety of games like: Medal of Honor, Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot and many other games as I became older. Which then became an original Xbox console, then a Nintendo Wii and then an Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 was when I experienced the world of Online Play, connecting to matchmaking lobbies on Call of Duty with my friends after school. I then built my first computer around 2011 when I decided to select Multimedia as an elective in school. I have since built two computers since then with massive leaps in performance between each build. Information Technology has been an interest since my early childhood, and I am looking forward to developing skills by studying through RMIT University to advance my passion into a career in the Cyber Security industry! </p>
								<p>Ideal Job – Cyber Security Operations Analyst. <br> An IT Security Operations Analyst works as a team member to monitor and combat threats to an organization's IT infrastructure. They also evaluate security systems and procedures for flaws and potential enhancements, as well as provide technical support for security systems. For this role, some responsibilities include, but are not limited to security audits, liaising with stakeholders and other IT personnel, being in-charge of networks and servers, complying with policies and delegations that are applicable, and meeting targets & resolve problems promptly. This position intrigues me due to the high demand in this field of security work and can be argued to be the most important role in contemporary IT. I believe this is due to the exponentially growing IT sector, which comes with its growing security risks. This section of IT I believe is imperative for not just large, but small businesses as IT grows and the demand for security will become higher. </p>

								<br>
								<p>I am 19 years old, and my family is Mauritian, well my mum’s side and my dad’s side are Australian. My personal hobbies include Cars, Gaming, and fitness. I have a kitten called ash and computers and technology is a love of mine. I Have been involved in technology since I was 12, the first thing was games. My passion for games grew as I got older, and my type of genre is fps while still enjoying single player games. My interest in IT is EVERYTHING, it does not need to be specific. I am interested in how we just get better and better on the internet, or pixels on a certain screen. How we have evolved in technology to now project visuals like augmented reality, and how IT is changing people's lives. All these things are so fascinating, and this is what makes me so interested in it. My ideal job is to be a software engineer or a games developer, they both are similar but so far from close. The skills needed for these jobs are general involvement with C/C++ and java, or something like python and other languages for specific positions. The most common thing I came across was an average of 3-4 years' experience with coding.  </p>

								<li>Personality Type: Defender -ISFJ-T    </li>
								<br>
								<p>I am 28 years old, born and raised in Byron Bay, a hardcore gamer and very interested in cyber security. I have a mug collection and I like cute things. My partner and I have 2 cats and foster kittens, we currently have 5 fosters. Technically I have played Dota 2 competitively but didn’t get very far. I have no professional IT work experience, but I attained my certificate IV in cyber security mid 2022. My interest in IT has been slowly growing ever since I was younger playing games on my home computer when I was around 12 or 13 years old. When the pandemic first started affecting Australia, I lost my full-time job. I struggled to find a career path that I wanted to follow, then I stumbled onto the job trainer program and jumped at the chance to study cyber security. Ever since starting my Certificate IV in cyber security, I have been very interested in and seeking a career in Cyber security. I gained firsthand experiences using various cyber security tools in assessments such as: Creating multiple virtual machines all set up on one physical computer so I could simulate a man in the middle attack to grab unencrypted credentials with Wireshark, creating and preforming a red vs blue incident response team exercise. There were other hands-on experiences, but those two stood out for me. These hands-on assessments really drove my hunger to continue to learn more about IT and cyber security.  </p>
								<p>My ideal job is a cyber security manager. This position is at the top of the cyber security roles in a cyber security company. The role involves running the Cyber security business unit, incident response, GRC, leading and managing a response team. This position is appealing to me as I have thought of myself as a leader, is a senior cyber security position, has different aspects of the career that I would like, it sounds fun and exciting, finally the pay is impressive. This role requires: Previous experience in a cyber security management role such as CSOC manager; Experience in Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC); Data Loss Prevention (DLP), cyber security toolsets and firewall configurations. Ability to manage a Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) Must be Motivated, self-driven, focused on continuous improvement, have strong problem-solving skills and able to adapt to changes. Finally, this role also requires a tertiary degree in IT or related discipline and any industry certifications related to cyber security would be beneficial.  </p>

I have 3 very adorable cats called Millie, Pearl and Roger My interests include drawing, music and gaming  
									
									This job is ideal because it is most likely the only local company that does software development. I would not have to relocate and it is a career that I am interested in. This job exists to develop and optimize the procreate application on iOS. 
									 
									For this job, knowledge of a programming language, C (or something similar) is required. They don’t require qualifications, but simply an example that shows you are capable of working for them. 
									 
									I have the enthusiasm for this company to work for them, they develop an application that I am quite interested in. I currently lack the expertise. Firstly, I would need to learn C. Secondly I should attempt to develop something to show my ability to work in the language. </p>

										<p>The above table shows that our team composition is great, and we don’t have multiple of the same personality types. We are however majority introverted (besides Adam), so it will most likely be hard for us to have long meetings or add much to the conversation as we’re more likely to not speak up. Majority of our team’s greatest big 5 trait is agreeableness, which may be a problem, if we all just agree to things even if its not in our best interest. Majority of the team (besides Lachlan) is high in neuroticism, which indicates that we will feel the effects of negative emotions so a more positive approach to things will be far more beneficial than a negative one. </p>

										<p>Lachlan will most likely be considered the leader or at least the one that drives meetings forward as virtuosos generally are great at projects. Lucy (Luke) will be a strong backbone and will work hard towards the deadline as a defender will, she will also be a great addition to mediation if there is any issues in the team. Adam is the only one in the team to be considered an extrovert. He is also a consul, He will act as the glue holding us together. He will fill in gaps in the work when needed and help us all work well together. Declan is a mediator, he will have great creativity and imagination, that will work well in creative projects such as the website. As mediators are generally empathetic, he will be a great asset if there are any team issues that need resolving or mediation.  Jason is a Logistician, He will work well and get his tasks completed on time, even if there are stressful situations. As logistician’s tend to pick up the slack, Jason will most likely help others who are falling behind or struggling to finish by the deadline. Courtenay is a Logician, who are great at deep thinking and very creative. Logicians have an analytic mind and love to analyze patterns. This will come in handy with creative tasks or tasks that require analysis.  </p>

								<h1>So, what is cloud?</h1>
								<img src="images/cloud.png" width="300" height="300">
								<p> 

								    “Jeff Bezos has likened Amazon Web Services to the utility companies of the early 1900s. One hundred years ago, a factory needing electricity would build its own power plant but, once the factories were able to buy electricity from a public utility, the need for pricey private electric plants subsided. AWS is trying to move companies away from physical computing technology and onto the cloud.”  
									
									investopedia- What Is Amazon Web Services and Why Is It So Successful?. 
									
									My anecdotally informed impression is that computing and storage are expensive to scale along with your customer base. As a company, your options are basically stop growing, build the infrastructure yourself (expensive), or rent the infrastructure from someone else (less expensive... most of the time). Data centers are the service that caters to that third option. 
									
									But what is cloud? Clouds are what happens when the biggest, baddest data centers eat all the other data centers, and everyone goes to them if they can't afford to make their own infrastructure. It's when remote computing and remote storage are provided to anyone with money and an internet connection. When I was in primary school, we got OneDrive, suddenly your schoolwork was available no matter what computer you logged into, because instead of being saved to an onboard hard drive you were saving it to a “cloud” hosted on, or across warehouses full of racks of computers probably halfway around the world. But OneDrive isn't “the cloud” it’s a service Microsoft provides. The cloud is the name given to remote computing as a whole. That cloud of invisible, centralized power, hosted on a bunch of data centers scattered around the world, is what we call, the “cloud” 
									
									what are services and servers? 
									
									“As of the first quarter of 2021, one independent analyst reports AWS has over a third of the market at 32.4%, with Azure following behind at 20%, and Google Cloud at 9%.”  
									
									Investopedia- What Is Amazon Web Services and Why Is It So Successful? 
									
									Right now, AWS and Azure (Microsoft) are slugging it out for market control, but aside from the percentage of the worlds data centers that they own, how do they have control? Services and servers is the answer. Services are products that these companies provide, like ms teams, but also more backend things, like the amazon API gateway. Services are like subdivisions of what AWS or Azure could provide as one package, they divide like this to allow customers to pay only for what they want, and so they can charge as much as possible for what they do provide.  
									
									What are servers? If you googled it you would get “a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.” but in a cloud setting they are more like slices of computing power. The key thing about cloud computing is it's not central to one location, it is access to computing power hosted from all over the world. So what companies do is they go out and sell access to that pool, that access is a “server” hence the name it “serves you”. That being said, I think usually what people mean when they say “server” is the computing and memory itself. 
									
									So to conclude, services are products that service providers like AWS and Azure provide, they either augment or enable certain features a customer wants, or they are  fully developed applications like ms teams. Servers are slices of the pool of computing power that cloud providers have, together with the “services” they form a blank slate of an online company. 
									
									 
									
									</p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3><p>
									
									I think the impact of all this is that its near impossible for growing companies to avoid cloud services. with AWS at more than 200 and counting, they really have something for everything, and I think its getting hard to justify not using AWS. I also feel that this also pushes companies more towards growth over profit, AWS is not cheap to maintain, its only so appealing because it makes growth easier for companies. Particularly Netflix who spend an enormous amount on AWS, because they were growing so fast they needed AWS to keep up.  
									
									If you follow this link, you’ll see pages and pages of services for a AWS customers, just like how we’re currently using Microsoft teams, because RMIT has the Microsoft suite. This makes it very difficult for businesses to leave AWS once they build their business around it. And its only when they get truly massive are they able to bear the cost of building their own solution. 
									
									“It was clear to us from the beginning that we’d have to build everything from scratch,” wrote Dropbox infrastructure VP Akhil Gupta on his company blog in 2016, “since there’s nothing in the open source community that’s proven to work reliably at our scale. Few companies in the world have the same requirements for scale of storage as we do.” 
									
									- Data Center Knowledge, Dropbox’s Reverse Migration, From Cloud to Own Data Centers, Five Years On 
									
									Another impact “pay for what you use” models have had is I think they’ve contributed to the massive push for data driven decision making, when you pay for 100% of your usage optimizing that usage to reduce costs is crucial. 
									
									Overall, I think clouds biggest impact is how it's made scaling possible, a decade ago companies could not grow like they can today, this isn't just the case for the company experiencing the need to scale either, companies don’t only use AWS for instance. They use all kinds of services like slack, zoom, Zendesk etc. All those companies also use cloud services, they can all scale to the demand of each other. That’s the impact of cloud services. 
									
									</p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3><p> 
									
									Well I plan to have a career in the IT sector, so at the very least I'll be working in a space enabled by clouds. I'll probably be using cloud run recourses in my Tech stack, and this is presuming that I don’t directly go into cloud engineering. As I said when I estimated its impact, cloud has changed the way companies develop, and I’ll experience the new way of doing things throughout my career. 
									
									While not directly linked, the trend of everything being accessible online has already had a massive impact on me, for starters I’m studying online. This has allowed me to begin my career without the massive upheaval that would come with moving to Melbourne to study on campus. Beyond that the rise of remote work, or WFH has also changed my life, I've been able to spend more time with my father (who works remotely) and as a family where only able to live where we are because of my father’s work being remote. 
									
									Interviewing for roles has also changed massively due to the shift to online. Where once, one had to physically go to an office, interviews are mostly online now, especially in the IT sector. I wonder if the ease of hiring contributed to the employee led market that’s being touted today. The speed at which masses of people can find new jobs today is pretty amazing. This hasn’t affected me directly yet, but it will when I enter the industry. I think 5 years ago working for more than 6-10 years at a company was rare in IT, now I think companies are straining to retain talent for more than the time it takes their stock options to mature. 
									
									I’d say it’s the rapid growth cloud allows that will affect me the most, how fast everything is and how ubiquitous technology can be because of it. </p>


									
									
									<h1>Cyber security</h1>
									<img src="images/cybersecurity.jpeg" width="500" height="300">
									<p> What does it do?
										 
										
										Cyber security is defined as the practice of defending computers, servers, networks, all types of IT devices and data from malicious attacks. These attacks generally fall into either; phishing, malware, ransom ware and social engineering. The more successful attacks will most likely use a combination of these 4 types. In essence cyber security in a business setting is all about reducing total costs when the eventuality of a cyberattack occurs.  
										
										There is a constant battle between cyber security professionals and the threat/bad actors (cyber attackers).  Is the company better protected and better prepared or has a new malware been created or vulnerability been found that may be the key in breaching the company's defenses? The methods and technologies that threat actors use is constantly evolving and so must the methods and technologies that companies use to protect themselves evolve in the same way.  
										
										An example of an attack is: A vulnerability is found in a newly updated software a company is running, which allows unauthorized access through the network. A black hat hacker targets this company because they are using this software that has this vulnerability. The hacker breaches the company network and has access to customer information. The company becomes aware of the attack when some data is accessed and stollen. The company contacts their cyber security operation center which begins their incident response procedure.  This will take many days and will cost the company in loss revenue and loss in trust by their customers as their data was stollen. In the end the attack has had a huge impact on the company which may never recover. This shows how important cyber security is.   
										
										The average cost to a larger company may be in the millions and the cost is increasing. “Data breach average cost increased 2.6% from USD 4.24 million in 2021 to USD 4.35 million in 2022. The average cost has climbed 12.7% from USD 3.86 million in the 2020 report.” This report also shows that during the pandemic there was a much greater growth in cost to companies.

										“Future conflict will involve sophisticated cyber warfare. Nations across the globe have recognized the strategic value and asymmetric advantage of investment in offensive cyber capabilities.” In the future, cyber security will be a major contributor in how conflicts and even wars play out. Australia and many other countries recognize this and have started to strengthen their cyber security in their defense sectors. In the future, wars may end before even 1 bullet, or one life is lost as the impact that a state sponsored cyberattack can have on a countries infrastructure and resources leads to ending the conflict before it has even begun.

										</p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3><p> 
										
										As cyber threats are constantly evolving and adapting to the current state of the world. As seen during, and post pandemic, there has been a large increase in the number of cyberattacks.  As technologies become more widely used and more popular, this also increases the likelihood of these technologies being impacted by a cyberattack. The more a technology is utilized the more profitable an attack is, more data to steal, more data to sell, more money to steal etc.  
										
										The pandemic has shifted a lot of companies into an operating model that focuses on employees safely which also encourages working from home. This also includes an increase in companies using software such as teams or zoom to conduct remote meetings. This new operating model must also include a level of cyber security that some companies are neglecting. The increase of usage of these virtual meeting applications also increases the amount of cyberattacks relating to these technologies. “Between February and May 2020 more than half a million people globally were affected by breaches in which the personal data of video conferencing users was stolen and sold on the dark web.” 
										
										There were 350 cyberattacks in Switzerland during April 2020, whereas 100-150 was the average before the pandemic. Not to mention the increase in phishing attacks and that “47% of individuals fall for a phishing scam while working at home”.  Cyber security is as important as ever, but individuals working from home have less support when it comes to the social engineering types of cyberattacks.  
										
										As the effects from the pandemic become more obvious, the need for stronger cyber security measures and an increase in education regarding how to protect yourself online and the ways threat actors operate will likely become more common place, especially for the businesses that continue to operate with a more work from home style.

										</p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3><p> 
										
										I am seeking a career in cyber security so the fact that there is a constant need for more cyber security professionals is welcomed. Though, it would be better if cyber security was not needed but that is just not the world that we live in.  As the cyber threats around the world are constantly changing, it is a good idea to keep up with current trends and stay informed about emerging cyber threats. People will need to stay aware of the potential that they may be a target of a cyberattack. That the increase of people utilizing online methods for business will also increase the likelihood of those businesses being affected by cyberattacks or data breaches which also increases the need for cyber security.  
										
										I believe that the future of wars and conflicts may end up having a large portion of operations run through state sponsored cyberattacks targeting countries supply lines and infrastructure. This may directly or indirectly affect me as Australia may be a target of said state sponsored cyberattack or may affect one of our main trading partners reducing Australia’s economy or resources. There is also the chance that I move into the defense force in the cyber security sector.  That would mean I would be at the front line of these conflicts and have a firsthand experience dealing with these state sponsored cyberattacks. </p>
										
										
										<h1>What is machine learning</h1>
										<img src="images/machinelearning.jpeg" width="450" height="300">
										<p>
											In the modern day, machine learning is the invisible technology that surrounds us. It is always there behind the scenes processing data. But what is it exactly? Essentially machine learning is a process in which a computer is fed a series of instructions and then set to work to identify and categorize data. An example of machine learning we see in our everyday lives is on Spotify. When we listen to a song on Spotify, the application will take that information and then supply the user with other songs that are similar. We, the user, give the machine information about what we enjoy, and it is then able to process it and suggest other songs for us to listen to. 
											
											There are three main machine learning algorithms that see wide use in the present, with a fourth gaining popularity. 
											
											Supervised Machine Learning 
											
											Unsupervised Machine Learning 
											
											Reinforcement Learning 
											
											These each have their own benefits and disadvantages as well as different uses in a variety of contexts but will continue to see usage for years to come. 
											
											Supervised Machine Learning is an algorithm where we input information that the program can then use to identify and categorize future inputs. For example, if we were to feed the program hundreds of images of cats and dogs, with each image being labelled, the algorithm would ideally be able to understand aspects of what makes a cat a cat, versus a dog. It will start looking for several aspects, like the shape of the eyes, ears, body and tail, the algorithm will then categorize it as either a cat or a dog. We commonly see this algorithm utilized in fraudulent email protection, determining a loan applicant’s viability and detecting fraudulent bank withdrawals. 
											
											Unsupervised Machine Learning is a somewhat messier approach. Essentially instead of teaching the algorithm what the information we are putting into it is, we will instead just allow the program to arbitrarily sort through the information and decide how to categorize it. This is useful to identify otherwise hidden patterns in datasets. This is widely seen in identifying customer’s behaviour, grouping it with other customers and recommending products based on the buying behaviour of other customers in the same group. 
											
											Reinforcement Learning is most closely related to how humans learn. Instead of being fed pre-labelled datasets, a machine running the algorithm is instead allowed to interact with its environment. The machine is then rewarded for its good behaviour and punished for its bad behaviour. Over time it is expected the machine can determine what it should do as opposed to what it shouldn’t do. This algorithm is often seen in robotics, self-driving cars and AI designed to play games. 
											
											Finally, a fourth algorithm is not fully embraced by everyone but is set to see more use in coming years. Semi-supervised Learning is a hybrid of supervised learning and unsupervised learning, hence the name. The algorithm is fed a small portion of labelled data, as well as a larger amount of unlabelled data, using this data it can sort the data to a high degree. Semi-supervised learning is still considered to be relatively new compared to the other methods but has already proven effective to minimize the issues that arise when using the other methods. 
											
											These algorithms are all seeing constant use presently but there are new innovations on the horizon, as with most cutting-edge technologies. Automated Machine Learning is already seeing some use but is expected to become much more refined in the near future. 
											
											</p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3><p>
											
												Automated Machine Learning exists to, as the name implies, automate the machine learning process. By doing so it becomes vastly more accessible to organisations that would not have had the resources prior to implement such technology. Machine learning was initially seen as something only available to large companies and organisations with seemingly bottomless funds. Automating the process means that these smaller companies can now utilise machine learning without requiring a team of experts to toil on the program for weeks on end. Instead, a model can be ready to go in a matter of days. 

												It’s been speculated that this trend towards automated machine learning will lead to the death of the data scientist. This job that was previously needed to plan, create and test machine learning models being simply no longer needed however that is entirely incorrect. Many data scientists are, if anything, extremely excited to see automated machine learning take off. This is because automating the process removes the more tedious parts of the job and gives them time to concentrate on refining their models. More to the point, one would think that with less need for dedicated data scientists the field would have seen a decline in recent years but surprisingly it has seen explosive growth. 
												
												Many people also see these developments in machine learning as a symptom of the tech industry’s evolution to automate more of its tedious tasks. Negating many of the more intricate details of machine learning such as choosing the most fitting algorithm or deciding what a company is looking for in their data will make the entry to becoming a data scientist much easier. These were previously problems that would make it significantly harder for budding graduates to enter the field. 
											
										    </p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3><p>
											
												With its automation, machine learning is now vastly more accessible to the general public than ever before. Not only can companies and organisations take advantage of this technology, but also regular people who do not have expert knowledge of machine learning. The layman can use machine learning to expedite various tasks either in their personal life or professional life. An example of how machine learning was used in a seemingly trivial way was when Google’s AlphaGo program beat a professional go player in 2016. The program was a beneficiary of machine learning, where it learnt to play go to such a high standard purely by playing against itself hundreds of thousands of times. This example features a tech giant celebrating the achievement, but with the automation of machine learning, this is vastly more accessible to anyone now. 

												We don’t need to be the ones using the technology for it to help us as individuals, however. We can all benefit from its use in agencies, companies and organisations. For example, healthcare may see a significant improvement. Utilizing machine learning helps to see previously unidentified patterns in disease management. Health problems that previously plagued humanity may soon see a substantial decrease in the population is affects, or in the severity of its symptoms. Potentially there’s also the possibility that machine learning could aid in identifying unknown ailments and give more accurate diagnoses. 
												
												Banks are also set to benefit from this development. Utilising machine learning, banks will be able to identify fraudulent transactions much faster. Looking at data such as location or amount spent compared to a customer’s usual spending habits, it will be able to quickly identify any unusual activity. With quicker identification of fraudulent transactions, banks can take action much faster compared to previous years where a customer’s entire account may become drained before appropriate action is taken. </p>



											<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
											<img src="images/autonomous.jpeg" width="550" height="300" >
											
											<p><h3>What does it do? </h3></p>
											The definition of autonomous vehicles is “An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car does everything that an experienced human driver does.”  Self-driving cars were never in the talks until modern technology was advanced enough to detect real life obstacles and translate it to react like humans do in a vehicle. It was first introduced with general cruise control which was developed to compute to your ecu on what speed you wanted to hold so electrically, it stayed around that threshold by calculating throttle speed and acceleration until the conditions were met, yet the driver still had control over the steering wheel and if in an emergency, auto brake detection was a thing as well as pressing the brake automatically canceled this option. It then was introduced that some vehicles in production were now able to park themselves without the control of the driver automatically uses sensers and a program that calculates what degree to turn the wheels to achieve that park. Some countries or states could deny the production of this simply for the safety and risk factors that muight come with it. Under law regulations they say “The regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of “zombie cars” driving around without passengers.” This really could be a factor, but a simple fix would be to not start driving if there is not a person present in the vehicle. The variety of opinions around this fact is big, some people do not like the fact that they are driving something they cannot even control or someone else could as well as talk about if someone hacks into it and controls it. You can never have FULL control over something that is controlling itself. Autonomous cars rely on cameras, sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, and powerful software's to react like a brain would in the situation of avoiding hitting something, but after testing and developing, a car would have to be approved to have experienced every and any situation that it might be in. It is a massive development because it cannot be finalized to handle every situation. To recreate a mind that is programmed is hard to observe and calculate outcomes without making mistakes, although these mistakes could cause a loss of life if not professionally designed.  There are multiple car companies that are working on finalizing what initially tesla released to the public, in 3 years they will be full autonomous controlled vehicles into production lines for the public to purchase. Technology is being developed at an alarming rate and has been getting better and better in such a brief period, people start to worry. The chances of a vehicle shutting down and the driver having no control, or it could swerve/react to something that it should not and harm the driver. Which brings me to my next point.
											
											<p><h3>What is the likely impact?</h3></p>
											This is likely to impact people perceptions on vehicles and drivers, but also effect why we even go for drivers' licences if we are not driving? Why are there restrictions for drivers if the drivers are not doing any driving. The price of this technology is not budget friendly either, you can also imagine why. A lot of money and testing must go into these sorts of things to minimise the risk factors of endangering someone on the road. This could send fuel prices to skyrocket with the popularity of vehicles being Eletric, which most will be with this technology, it effects combustion engines. People will lose the skill to drive and be in control of scenarios if FULLY autonomous. Although you can argue this could be a safer approach, not everything is going to go perfect. Imagine the possibilities of a moving vehicle weighing over 1 ton+ traveling at a speed in which is being controlled by a system, and not a human. Human logic in some accidents tend to be avoided with the fast thinking and reaction time.  Current mechanics will not be able to service these vehicles that have this. The new production line of Tesla's proves that if own a tesla, only the manufacturer has the tools and keys to perform that. This impacts mechanics that specialise in combustions engines and manual tuning. Mechanical engineers or the automotive industry already took a hit with the popularity with electric vehicles because if customers take their vehicles to a mechanic that is not the manufacturer, it voids the warranty. 

											<p><h3>How will this affect you?</h3></p>
											Now this question is biased due to the fact my hobby and love for vehicles is influenced by this. I do not have any problems with electric vehicles, but combustions engines are just what I love to get itty and giddy about. Customisation is hard in an electric vehicle since once again, modifications are hard to do to something that is electric, and you cannot exactly pull and pick things from without damaging the internals. The market shows this since electric vehicles are skyrocketing, that could be due to popularity or choices. I know people would much rather electric vehicles over petrol but there is a big community of “car enthusiasts” that’s passion is built off these cars.  

											If they were to change regulations on what vehicles can be on the road and what cant, some families cannot afford these new electric vehicles but also losing the ability to control the vehicle entirely is a no no. I love to drive with my friends and (follow the law obviously 😉) but taking that away destroys the skill and fun that can come with these things. NOW the argument is entirely based off if you can toggle between these things but if the car is made to be fully autonomous, the chances of that passing through regulations and laws is unlikely. The driver must be in control of the vehicle when on the road or at least eyes on the road and not doing something else. That defeats the point they are trying to make it for but there is a time and place for all these things, when in a vehicle on the road with other peoples lives and safety in your hands this should not be a thing that is normalised.

						        <h2 class="major"> Group Project Idea </h2>
								<h2>Overview of "Goblin" </h2>
							    <p>Goblin will be a python application aimed at providing a way of recording the chat histories of commonly used communication services like slack, discord, and the RMIT forums. </p>
								<p>Unlike chat aggregators for managing chat interactions across multiple platforms that work by sending a copy of the message to a central location. Goblin will be an application that text is pasted into, allowing for “retro-active” recording of text history. </p>
								<p>The point of Goblin is to allow the user to manage small to medium sized chat histories so that they can be organized, searched, and posted on different services.  </p>
								<p>Goblin will be an application with some minimal UI a text box, the Idea is that the user selects all the relevant channel history and copy pastes it into the text box (hence the name, Goblin gobbles the text you put IN). The application then separates the wall of text into individual messages and records the name of the user who posted the message, the time stamp on the message, and the content of the message. Those messages will form a “snapshot” which can then be saved to an existing history or saved as a new history. </p>
								<p>The aim is to make it easy to store all of one’s chat histories so that they can be searched on and organized, so that it can be easily moved to different platforms or simply saved for later. </p>
								<br>

								<h2>Context and goals:</h2>
								<h3>Why?</h3>
								<p>Currently it’s common to use a wide array of communication methods regularly. For example, right now as I type this, I have discord, slack, MS Teams, Gmail, and Outlook open on my PC. Now, in our daily life we are unlikely to find a need to record or move what goes on in one of those services to a different one, and on the off chance that you do, copy and pasting or screenshotting is usually good enough. However, in a hypothetical scenario where you are a student at RMIT and you are required to use the canvas forums, and later MS Teams, you may find yourself wishing that what was on the forums or the unofficial discord was also on teams…. Enter Goblin.  </p>
								<p>Goblin is aimed at making it easy to record and repost chat histories from different services</p>
								<p>Use-case:  

									A searchable archive of all your chat histories  
								
								if you want to find your response to a question on a forum that you no longer have access to, you can find it in your Goblin records. </p>
								<p>    Making copying histories from one place to another while retaining a readable format easy. 

									If you had a really informative private conversation about a project on discord, and would like to make it available to the group on MS Teams, Goblin could be used to format and post that entire conversation to teams. </p>
								<p>    Reformatting text chat “dumps” 

									Because Goblin reformats the pasted chat dump into a standard format, so that it can filter messages by date, sender, or keywords, it can provide data for analysis of chat records where the data is kept in its original form. </p>
								<p>    Understanding data from unintegrated sources 

									For example, if you wanted to know how many times the phrase “I hate MS Teams” was used on the unofficial Intro to Computer Science discord. Once you had stored the data in Goblin you would be able to know both the answer to that question and be able to see what messages contained the phrase. What’s unique about Goblin is that collecting this data doesn’t require an integration with the service that you’re taking the data from. No API calls, nothing. </p>
								<p>    The ability to migrate histories of entire platforms from one place to another 

									My personal project from ITT assignment 1 was a concept like Goblin, the idea was to forward the canvas forum update emails to a slack bot that would post the contents of the forum posts to a slack server, essentially automatically replicating the RMIT forums on slack. I received feedback that it was an interesting concept and could have potential use as an internal tool for a team testing the viability of moving the forums to slack. Goblin aims to be a more robust tool designed to assist in that sort of endeavor. It isn’t as sleek and fancy as something that is fully automatic and integrated, but it can be applied to a wide array of platforms with no additional programing.  </p>
								
								<h3>How will it work?</h3>
								<p> The application can be thought of in 4 main parts </p>

								<h4>Input: </h4>
								<p>The input is the text that gets pasted in. this will then be sent to the middleware module to be processed </p>

								<h4>Middleware: </h4>
								<p>Once something has been entered, it needs to be broken up and stored. it’s expected that large amounts of text will be pasted in at once, so the program needs to break that text up into the original messages and store them. Data editing and deletion should be supported as well. When histories are stored there should be an option to add descriptions and tags, summaries as metadata. </p>

								<h4>Output:</h4>
								<p>When the database is searched it will output the desired chat. </p>

								<h4> The UI: </h4>
								<p> A user interface that combines the input and output features to make creation, search and deletion of chats easy and intuitive.  </p>

								<h3>Technology: </h3>
								<p>The key technologies that need to function for the application to accomplish what it should are as follows: </p>

								<h4>Record management functionality: </h4>
								<p>The app will need to do things like; save to an existing history, save as new history, delete history. As well as some filtering functionality that allows users to sort/locate individual messages or display sections of a history. This will be handled by SQLite a free SQL database manager that is easy to implement and widely used. SQLite was chosen as opposed to a larger package like mySQL because its lighter weight and simpler to use for a python program like Goblin. SQLite is also appealing because it runs on the local machine, instead of being cloud based like some other options I looked at. SQLite is also a relational database manager. A relational database is ideal for this use case because of how they’re intrinsically designed to associate one set of information (in this case date, source, subject matter, original sender as well as any other information that was attached when saved) with another (the content of the message). SQLite is a very commonly used tool but it was chosen mainly for how easy it is to implement, and use was the main reason I think it should be used for the database management.  </p>

								<h4>Managing the data:  </h4>
								<p>The point of Goblin is primarily a data manager for message histories. So, if nothing else the data management should well implemented. SQLite will be what we use to handle this, and it was chosen specifically because it’s lightweight and easy to use.  </p>
								<p>Having not been trained in SQLite at all, I spent about two or three hours talking to my dad about what needs to be done there to achieve what goblin needs. This is my preliminary understanding; there needs to be at least 2 tables, one that contains information attached to the actual snippet (an individual message) and another table for the tags that the user may specify about a given chat dump. </p>
								<p>The tag table needs to be separate because if it wasn’t it would massively complicate editing the tags if they were tangled up in the rest of the data about a snippet. The tags are the main way users can define information about what they’re storing. It’s expected that even with tags, what’s stored in goblin could get very messy, at this point in the design its up to the user to keep everything readable using the tagging method, so editing, deleting, and adding tags is a very important feature. </p>
								<p>The snippet table contains the inferred information like the author, date, and tag ID. As well as a user defined field called source, where the user defines where the snippet came from. The table also contains the snippet itself. The tag ID is what associates the tags in the tag table with the snippet table </p>

								<h3>A Bare Bones UI </h3>
								<p>The UI will be created using 'tkinter' in python. It will need to have buttons, output tables and input boxes for the basic functionality of Goblin.  </p>
								<p>Refer to the image below for a mockup of the UI</p>

								<img src="images/goblin.png" width="400" height="400">

								<p>In general, I propose to model the UI after the slack or discord UI except instead of channels on the left bar there’s the metadata tag list, and where the messages would be in slack is where the selected file displayed. </p>

								<h3>Text formatting capability: </h3>
								<p>The ways different services format their content need to be accounted for, ideally Goblin should be able to store most common forms of written communication emails, slack messages, discord messages and forum posts etc. Goblin will need to have a way of transforming the content of all these formats so that it can filter the information properly. This will be developed by the group in python.  </p>

								<h2>Challenges & required skills:</h2>
								<h3>Sorting:</h3>
								<p>Sorting the messages, isolating the sender, the time, and the message content is tricky given that there is only loose consistency in the formats we can expect. This will require a backend solution to be developed, something that “recognizes” the content based on the source tag. Or a front-end UI based solution where the user tells the program how the text is formatted e.g.; this string is who sent the message, this is the time stamp, and if all the other messages are formatted the same way.  </p>

								<h3>Building the UI</h3>
								<p>This is something that I don’t think I, or anyone in my group has experience with, although the requirements are quite common things to do in python/windows. Simply because we’ve never done anything like this there may be planned features that turn out to be quite difficult to implement. </p>

								<h3>Handling un-transportable content: </h3>
								<p>Some content is not going to be accessible when copied, such as some emoji’s, links to sites, images etc. these will show up as URLs in the input box. I’m not sure how they should be handled from a UX point of view. Removing them, if possible, may make messages less readable. Leaving them in my mean that you have snippets that are the word “lol”, followed by a 100-character long URL for an image. I'm not sure how this challenge should be handled. </p>

								<h3>Exporting the data, APIs and UIs: </h3>
								<p>Something I’ve been very hesitant to add to the scope of this project is the application having integrations to allow it to automatically post a history if told to. This would be an incredibly useful function and wouldn’t be too hard to develop for a platform like slack as there are tools there that make it much easier like Block kit. But as my understanding of the challenges and skillset requirements is so limited, I’m not sure if delivering on this sort of functionality is possible. This is a “nice to have” not part of the core set of features </p>

								<p>
									The tools we utilised for this assignment were Microsoft Teams, Discord, GitHub, MS Visual Studio Code and Office365.
								</p>
								<p>
									On Microsoft Teams, we were able to organise and record team meetings, as well as use a “bucket” system. The bucket system allowed us to easily monitor and track our assignment with progression on tasks, users ticked off items that were finished which could be tracked by all group members. A “to-do” bucket was created, as well as “finished” and “currently being worked on” buckets. This system allowed the group members to track progression with ease, and without having to rely on other members being online. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Discord was utilised for the purpose of a general chat group, as we had difficulties with the notification system on MS Teams.
								</p>
								<p>
									GitHub was utilised for committing changes to the website. This function was used for multiple reasons, as the group had two members working on the website at the same time. It allowed the group to track progression but also created backups to the website coding. This is advantageous for diagnosing errors in coding, as committing changes frequently 	
								</p>
								<p>
									MS Visual Studio code was the program we utilised for creating and editing code. This program also has a build in function to commit changes to GitHub.
								</p>
								<p>
									Office365 was utilised for creating and editing text documents. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, this allowed the group to collaborate virtually with freedom and ease, allowing all of us to share inputs and ideas at any given time.
