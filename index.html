								<p>I was born in the United States of America, grew up in Tasmania from ages 1-13, where I exclusively lived on a 32ft motor sailing yacht. My family then moved to Melbourne, and shortly after, to Bangalore India for 9 months, then back to Melbourne. I’ve played a lot of video games in my teens, and I hope to have a career in software development and eventually management. I’m interested in development and development management because of how tangible the problems are, and how effectual solving them can be. IT in general is a field of solution pursuit and I find that appealing. My Ideal job was an engineer in AWS’s quickstep team. Which is responsible for building “Quickstep”, a high-performance caching server, for amazons CloudFront. They are looking for applicants comfortable with agile, large-scale systems, web design, a modern programming language like rust, C/C++ or c#, and architecture/design. As well as ~5 years’ experience.  </p>

								<br>
								<p>Hello there! My name is Adam Howell and I am currently studying Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology through Open University Australia, working in Group #40 called “Unicorn”. A little history about me, I'm a certified mechanic and had worked in the field for close to nine years. I decided to step away from that role and enter an industry of something I've also been passionate about, the world of I.T! I grew up playing video games from a very young age, my father brought home a PlayStation One with his first paycheck from his new job when I was around 5 years old. I grew up playing a variety of games like: Medal of Honor, Gran Turismo, Crash Bandicoot and many other games as I became older. Which then became an original Xbox console, then a Nintendo Wii and then an Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 was when I experienced the world of Online Play, connecting to matchmaking lobbies on Call of Duty with my friends after school. I then built my first computer around 2011 when I decided to select Multimedia as an elective in school. I have since built two computers since then with massive leaps in performance between each build. Information Technology has been an interest since my early childhood, and I am looking forward to developing skills by studying through RMIT University to advance my passion into a career in the Cyber Security industry! </p>

								<br>
								<p>I am 19 years old, and my family is Mauritian, well my mum’s side and my dad’s side are Australian. My personal hobbies include Cars, Gaming, and fitness. I have a kitten called ash and computers and technology is a love of mine. I Have been involved in technology since I was 12, the first thing was games. My passion for games grew as I got older, and my type of genre is fps while still enjoying single player games. My interest in IT is EVERYTHING, it does not need to be specific. I am interested in how we just get better and better on the internet, or pixels on a certain screen. How we have evolved in technology to now project visuals like augmented reality, and how IT is changing people's lives. All these things are so fascinating, and this is what makes me so interested in it.   </p>

								<p>I am 28 years old, born and raised in Byron Bay, a hardcore gamer and very interested in cyber security. I have a mug collection and I like cute things. My partner and I have 2 cats and foster kittens, we currently have 5 fosters. Technically I have played Dota 2 competitively but didn’t get very far. I have no professional IT work experience, but I attained my certificate IV in cyber security mid 2022. My interest in IT has been slowly growing ever since I was younger playing games on my home computer when I was around 12 or 13 years old. When the pandemic first started affecting Australia, I lost my full-time job. I struggled to find a career path that I wanted to follow, then I stumbled onto the job trainer program and jumped at the chance to study cyber security. Ever since starting my Certificate IV in cyber security, I have been very interested in and seeking a career in Cyber security. I gained firsthand experiences using various cyber security tools in assessments such as: Creating multiple virtual machines all set up on one physical computer so I could simulate a man in the middle attack to grab unencrypted credentials with Wireshark, creating and preforming a red vs blue incident response team exercise. There were other hands-on experiences, but those two stood out for me. These hands-on assessments really drove my hunger to continue to learn more about IT and cyber security.  </p>

											<br>
											<p>There are some similarities between some of our group members in their ideal role career paths. </p>
											
											<p>Firstly, for all our group members career paths, the starting point is to complete a bachelor's degree in either Information Technology, Computer Science, or a related field. This tends to be a requirement in most IT roles, so should be completed by all group members. </p>

											<p>Lucy and Adam have chosen a career in Cyber security, so their career paths are similar. At least to begin with. Lucy has chosen a management role which is more of a senior role. This means that it would take longer for her to reach her desired ideal job than it would for Adam who has chosen a cyber security operations analyst as their desired role. This role is more of a middle level position so would not require as long to reach. </p>

											<p>Declan and Courtenay have chosen software development as their desired roles. As the roles are the exact same, their career paths should be almost identical. There is however the option of completing a boot camp or short intensive course in software development to obtain experience instead of completing the bachelor's degree. This is where their career paths could differ. </p>

											<p>Lachlan’s Career path will be like Decklan and Courtenay’s, but as a Software development manager is a senior position, will take longer to reach than that of a software engineer which can range from entry level to senior level. </p>

											<br>
											<br>
											<br>
											

											<h2>Group Processes</h2>

											<br>

											<p>We planned and had meetings when majority of the group members were available when we were working on Assessment 2.  We have attempted to have more focused meetings where group members working on the same tasks would have meetings themselves. This allows more freedom with meetings as not all members need to attend.  The workload on Assessment 2 was a little uneven so we have tried to correct that with better planning and splitting up the workload more evenly while utilizing personal strengths. </p>

											<p>Jason has also decided to leave the group and not continue to study IT. Jason has not worked on any aspects towards assessment 3 or 5. We will now need to split up his share of the workload between the other group members. </p>

						<!-- Goblin - Detailed Description -->
							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major"> Group Project Idea "Goblin" </h2>
								<h2>Project Description (Concept)  </h2>

							    <p>Goblin is our group project, it started out as a fundamentally stupid, clunky and useless idea called Slack’as. The idea of Slack’as was to somehow take the content of the forums RMIT uses, and put that on a slack server, the best way I figured “how” that could be done was to take the forum activity emails, forward them to a slack bot on a slack server, then post those forum posts to the relevant pre-made channels in the server. The main problem with this was that it relied on using the activity emails, and they are just not designed to be used like that. For example, they don’t include the entirety of longer posts, just the first few lines, they might have their format changed later down the line, throwing our bot into disarray. But the main glaring issue with Slack’as was sorting all the forum posts based of the limited information in the emails, the project was just too reliant on one source of information.  </p>

								<p>Goblin was the idea the group arrived at for assessment 2, it was based off the same principle; taking text from one social media and putting it somewhere else in a usable format. But it was to be its own application, something that a user could copy paste their own text into, to be formatted and potentially pasted somewhere else. Goblin also had a more realistic approach what we could and couldn’t achieve at our skill level and was more aligned with the interests and capabilities of the group than previous versions.  </p>

								
								<br>

								
								<h2>So why use an application like Goblin? </h2>

								<p>Currently, it’s common to use a wide array of communication methods regularly. For example, right now as I type this, I have discord, slack, MS Teams, Gmail, and Outlook open on my PC. Now, in our daily life we are unlikely to find a need to record or move what goes on in one of those services to a different one, and on the off chance that you do, copy and pasting or screenshotting is usually good enough.   </p>

								<p>However, in a hypothetical scenario where you are a student at RMIT and you are required to use the canvas forums, and later MS Teams, you may find yourself wishing that what was on the forums, or the unofficial discord was also on teams. This is where Goblin comes in! Goblin is aimed at making it easy to record and repost chat histories from different services.  </p>

								<br>

								<h2>How will Goblin work? </h2>

							
								<p> The application will consist of four major components: 

									A searchable archive of all your chat histories  
								
								if you want to find your response to a question on a forum that you no longer have access to, you can find it in your Goblin records. </p>
								<p>    Making copying histories from one place to another while retaining a readable format easy. 

									If you had a really informative private conversation about a project on discord, and would like to make it available to the group on MS Teams, Goblin could be used to format and post that entire conversation to teams. </p>
								<p>    Reformatting text chat “dumps” 

									Because Goblin reformats the pasted chat dump into a standard format, so that it can filter messages by date, sender, or keywords, it can provide data for analysis of chat records where the data is kept in its original form. </p>
								<p>    Understanding data from unintegrated sources 

									For example, if you wanted to know how many times the phrase “I hate MS Teams” was used on the unofficial Intro to Computer Science discord. Once you had stored the data in Goblin you would be able to know both the answer to that question and be able to see what messages contained the phrase. What’s unique about Goblin is that collecting this data doesn’t require an integration with the service that you’re taking the data from. No API calls, nothing. </p>
								<p>    The ability to migrate histories of entire platforms from one place to another 

									My personal project from ITT assignment 1 was a concept like Goblin, the idea was to forward the canvas forum update emails to a slack bot that would post the contents of the forum posts to a slack server, essentially automatically replicating the RMIT forums on slack. I received feedback that it was an interesting concept and could have potential use as an internal tool for a team testing the viability of moving the forums to slack. Goblin aims to be a more robust tool designed to assist in that sort of endeavor. It isn’t as sleek and fancy as something that is fully automatic and integrated, but it can be applied to a wide array of platforms with no additional programing.  </p>

									<br>
									<br>
								
								<h3>How will it work?</h3>
								<p> The application can be thought of in 4 main parts </p>

								

								<h4>Input: </h4>
								<p>The input is the text that gets pasted in. this will then be sent to the middleware module to be processed </p>

								

								<h4>Middleware: </h4>
								<p>Once something has been entered, it needs to be broken up and stored. it’s expected that large amounts of text will be pasted in at once, so the program needs to break that text up into the original messages and store them. Data editing and deletion should be supported as well. When histories are stored there should be an option to add descriptions and tags, summaries as metadata. </p>

								

								<h4>Output:</h4>
								<p>When the database is searched it will output the desired chat. </p>

								

								<h4> The UI: </h4>
								<p> A user interface that combines the input and output features to make creation, search and deletion of chats easy and intuitive.  </p>

								<br>

								<p>As we’ll dive further into the description of this project a little later, we will provide screenshots on how the application is projected to operate. </p>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h2>Technology: </h2>
								<p>The key technologies that need to function for the application to accomplish what it should are as follows: </p>
								<br>

								<h4>Record management functionality: </h4>
								<p>The app will need to do things like; save to an existing history, save as new history, delete history. As well as some filtering functionality that allows users to sort/locate individual messages or display sections of a history. </p>
								
								<p>This will be handled by SQLite a free SQL database manager that is easy to implement and widely used. SQLite was chosen as opposed to a larger package like MySQL because it’s lighter weight and simpler to use for a python program like Goblin. SQLite is also appealing because it runs on the local machine, instead of being cloud based like some other options I looked at. SQLite is also a relational database manager.  
								</p>

								<p>A relational database is ideal for this use case because of how they’re intrinsically designed to associate one set of information (in this case date, source, subject matter, original sender as well as any other information that was attached when saved) with another (the content of the message). SQLite is a very commonly used tool, but it was chosen mainly for how easy it is to implement, and use was the main reason I think it should be used for database management. </p>

								<h4>Managing the data:  </h4>

								<p>The point of Goblin is primarily a data manager for message histories. So, if nothing else the data management should be well implemented. SQLite will be what we use to handle this, and it was chosen specifically because it’s lightweight and easy to use.  </p>

								<p>Having not been trained in SQLite at all, I spent about two or three hours talking to my dad about what needs to be done there to achieve what goblin needs. This is my preliminary understanding; there needs to be at least 2 tables, one that contains information attached to the actual snippet (an individual message) and another table for the tags that the user may specify about a given chat dump. </p>

								<p>The tag table needs to be separate because if it wasn’t it would massively complicate editing the tags if they were tangled up in the rest of the data about a snippet. The tags are the main way users can define information about what they’re storing. It’s expected that even with tags, what’s stored in goblin could get very messy. At this point in the design, it's up to the user to keep everything readable using the tagging method, so editing, deleting, and adding tags is a very important feature.  </p>

								<p>The snippet table contains the inferred information like the author, date, and tag ID. As well as a user defined field called source, where the user defines where the snippet came from. The table also contains the snippet itself. The tag ID is what associates the tags in the tag table with the snippet table  </p>

								<br>

								<h3>A Bare Bones UI </h3>
								<p>The UI will be created using ‘tkinter’ in Python, where the application will be developed. It will need to have buttons, output tables and input boxes for the basic functionality of Goblin.  </p>
								<p>Here is an example of the UI, as provided in Assignment Two. </p>

								<img src="images/goblin.png" width="500">

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h3>Text formatting capability: </h3>
								<p>The ways different services format their content need to be accounted for, ideally Goblin should be able to store most common forms of written communication emails, slack messages, discord messages and forum posts etc. Goblin will need to have a way of transforming the content of all these formats so that it can filter the information properly. This will be developed by the group in python.   </p>

								<br>

								<h3>Why develop Goblin?</h3>

								<p>Goblin is a cool project from a developer point of view, it’s straightforward and touches on a lot of areas in demand in today’s job market. It's also very do-able from a proof-of-concept point of view. </p>

								<p>Aiding in communication: If there’s one thing that’s required by all our groups’ ideal career paths, it’s communication skills, Goblin is a project designed to augment traditional tools for communication. It was born from frustration with the avenues required for us to use as students. If it was ever made into a complete application, it would provide the development team and potentially customers with valuable data around how different communication tools are used. </p>

								<p>It's an SQL based project:</p>

								<img src="images/activeselections.PNG" width="500">

								<p>In Assessment 2, when we looked at the most in-demand skills that the most in demand skill sets that we could explore in a project at our skill level, SQL was the obvious choice. SQL is THE highest demand skill in the 2017-2018 burning glass study. The language used to create and manage databases, and in this time in tech where data driven decision making is all the rage, SQL is very relevant. </p>

								<br>

								<h3>What other "goblins" are out there? </h3>

								<p>How else is the problem of having messages in one place, and needing them in another solved? </p>

								<p>Well at the small-scale side, its handled by snip and sketch, you just “win+shift+s” and paste the relevant post wherever you want, nothing is more convenient or easier for an Indvidual to do. BUT it is problematic at scale, no one wants to catch up on a day’s worth of arguing over features in a google doc via screenshots. </p>

								<p>At the other extreme is the fully automatic approach that companies like Zendesk use internally. Some Zendesk customers like epic games for example use discord to handle customer interactions, but the customer service people don’t use discord, they use the Zendesk text window, that window sends 2 copies of the message out, one to discord, and the other to the internal location that the customer service interactions are stored. This works well for the relatively massive scale that Zendesk operates at, but such a solution is hilariously over engineered for a single user and would be impossible for even a single full-time developer to maintain. </p>

								<p>There are also SaaS companies like SimpleTexting or CallHub, which provide a way to personalize text message marketing to retailers. They gather and sell customer data to retailers to improve their SMS marketing. As part of that business, they manage databases of text messages. </p>


								<br>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h1>Detailed Description </h1>

								<h2>Aims</h2>

								<p>Goblin aims to be a middle of the road between screenshotting and a completely automated api-webhook type solution. Goblin should be easy to use, and provide a way for single users, and possibly small teams to manage their text data across multiple platforms. Our vision for Goblin is that one day a user could take an entire chat history of a discord server from which they’re about to lose access, and with a single ctrl-v have all that information saved.  </p>

								<p>Here are the main goals that need to be reached in order to produce the goblin we envision:   </p>

								<p>A user interface; in order Goblin for goblin to be an app, it needs a user interface, but there's more to it than that. There are elements such as generating snippet ID’s that ideally would be created when the data is entered. Additionally, since all the database interaction takes place through the UI, how useful the database is will largely depend on how usable the UI is. The preliminary concept for the UI is outlined in detail further into the document, but the goal of the UI is to make it as intuitive, and as useful as possible.  </p>

								<p>The backend infrastructure; the backend in this context is “all the stuff that doesn’t facilitate human interactivity”. This is required for things like the databases in which the snippets are stored, the searching algorithms, the code required to launch the application, windows API functions, and the like, there’s so much in this category that due to our inexperience we don’t even know we need but sorting that out definitely constitutes a goal. </p>

								<p>A message “sorter”; this is the most obviously fraught area of the project, frankly, having users paste large amounts of messages from an unknown source makes it a nightmare to isolate the Indvidual components. Even telling where one message ends and the next begins is extremely hard, because in the UI’s that these messages come from, they’re broken up into clearly separate messages by the UI, and the way it formats itself with profile pictures and such. As a group we haven't yet figured out any reliable way of sorting these messages without the use of a machine learning program, which we want to avoid, because a ML program will never be 100% accurate and any errors that it makes will be extremely obvious to users. So, sorting out the “sorting” issue is another main goal of the project. </p>

								<p>We think Goblin has the potential to be developed into a web-based application, rather than a local based application. This will allow the model of the project to really come to life, with the potential of a subscription-based modelling service to allow the application to be used across not just PC/MacOS, but also smart devices.  </p>

								<p>Goblin also has the potential to become automated, with information/text not being required to be entered by a user, but by the application “sniffing” for the information. We imagine this could be done by “Application migration/connections”, an example of this would be how Spotify connects to Discord and broadcasts what music you are listening to at the time to your friends/server mates. Automation of information storage will be a huge convenience to the user. </p>

								<br>

								<h2>UI Demonstration </h2>

								<p>This is where we showcase a far more detailed plan on what Goblin will look like, and how the application will function.  </p>

								<p>Starting off as a simple idea from Lachlan Deck, our group grew the idea of what the application can be used for, both professionally and privately. Most of the project idea has been headed by Lachlan, as he had brought forth the group project idea and had a solid vision of how the application will be utilised and developed. </p>

								<p>First, we’ll share what the base UI design will look like for Goblin, and we’ll share further details about the functions and capabilities of the base version.. </p>

								<br>
								<br>

								<h2>Introducing, Goblin!</h2>

								<br>
								

								<img src="images/Capture.PNG" width="1200">

								<br>

								<p>Welcome to Goblin, the “multi-application text organiser”. </p>

								<p>The base UI is designed to be as user friendly as possible, whilst delivering information stored by our users with efficiency.  </p>

								<p>Here, we’ll go over some of the key features located in the application. </p>

								<br>

								<h3>First, the Input</h3>

								<img src="images/input.png.gif" width="1000">

								

								<p>Using the Input box, you’ll copy the information/text as desired and paste into the text box on Goblin. From there, select the drop-down box which currently says “Skype”. Here you will choose what source you’ll save the information as on Goblin. As a scenario, I have copied a text conversation with one of my work colleagues from Skype and pasted it into the text box. Once completed, simply click the “Submit” button. This will log the desired text provided by the user and store it. Fairly simple! </p>

								<h3>Next, the Output</h3>

								<img src="images/output.PNG" width="1000">

								<p>Using the scenario from the Input section, we have stored the information we copied from Skype and pasted into Goblin. The way to locate the information can be one of two ways, one of those ways is utilising the “search bar”, located at the top right of the interface. Here, you can search for keywords in the text that has been stored. As we have only entered one entity through the program, we only receive one search result. You can also view which source the information was saved from, which can be selected by the Input function. The entry also logged a time stamp, located under the source name of the search field. This will allow the user to revisit the application and locate the relevant information if required to. </p>

								<br>

								<h3>Lastly, we have the Tags feature. </h3>

								<img src="images/tags.PNG" width="1000">

								<p>As our mock scenario, let’s say we had a conversation as a team on Skype, which we have copied and pasted into Goblin. However, one of my work colleagues was unable to sign into Skype and further meetings were required on other applications. Using our Tags function, you’ll be able to tag entries as you desire. In this scenario, we’ll use our self-generated tag of “Assignment 3”. Using this tag, it allows us to also search for tags we’ve allocated to some entries, here you’ll find an example of this in action. Using the function of “tag:” in the search bar, the ability to search for specific tags becomes available, which you can find two different sources being found under the tag feature.  </p>

								<p>That wraps up the concept of Goblin, for now. This application will develop more as time progresses, new features will be added and easier ways to tag and save text will become available.  </p>

								<p>At Team Unicorn, none of us have the skills required to make this application a reality (yet). This was a major dead-end in the hopes to build a functioning demonstration for the application and use it in a single use scenario. However, we are extremely confident this will provide thorough insight into how Goblin will operate.  </p>

								<br>
								<br>
							

								<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

								<p>As Goblin is currently designed for text and information storage/organising, the applications scope is well within sight. We say this because with technology today, there isn’t really a way to store information like there is with Goblin. However, the world of IT is growing at a rapid pace and will change the way the world operates.  </p>

				

								<p>Despite all our far off hopes we talked about in the aims section, we have very concrete deliverables for a proof-of-concept version, we also know what a baseline “finished” version of goblin would look like, and both of those need to happen before a web version is to be put in the works.  </p>

								<p>This breaks the project into 3 main phases of development and testing: </p>

								<h3>Proof of concept: </h3>

								<p>This is what's done so far, it’s what we’ve determined to be achievable in our timeframe and with our current skills, everything that would take more than an afternoon’s googling to learn is determined to be out of scope. </p>

								

								

								<br>
								<br>

								<h2> Risks</h2>

								<p>Since Goblin will be stored on local machines as an application & have no form of online capability, the risk for file/date corruption or loss is high. This could be in the form of hardware failure (HDDs, SSDs, USB flash drives etc) or local OS failures (Microsoft, MacOS etc).  </p>

								<p>A risk could be considered in the department of data breaches. Data should be encrypted locally, as well as have the ability for the Goblin to decrypt this date in real time to display the data as desired.  </p>

								<h2> Testing </h2>

								<p>Goblin has been created using SQLite and python coding languages. </p>

								<p>Just like all coding languages there testing muct be done to ensure that the code is working as intended. Just like if you go to hospital we will also use triage to; Determine the severity of the bug or issue, which will allow us to prioritize the more serious or fatal bugs before handing the less serious ones.  </p>

								<p>We have planned for 3 stages of testing;  </p>

								<p>1: Testing during development. </p>

								<p>2: Alpha Testing.</p>

								<p>3: Beta Testing.</p>

								<p>Testing during development is refering to the troubleshooting performed when the code is firstly created. When the coder is creating the code, they will perform constant checks to see if what they just entered works as intended. This may include using the built in print() module to check values of variables are certain places or running blocks of code and seeing if the expected outcome is received.  </p>

								<h2>Database demonstration </h2>
								<br>

								<p>Initially the idea for the .db file scheme was to have two tables, one containing the snippet info, and the other containing the user given tags. In the snippet table, there would be a column for the author, date, message content, a unique message ID, and tag ID associated with that row. </p>

								<p>In tag table there would be a column for every row in the snippet table (automatically generated as part of the function that inserted the data into both tables), this would allow users to add as many tags as they wanted to individual snippet. </p>

								<p>It would look like this in an XL-like structure. </p>

								<p>Note that this represents how a table looks in sqlite3 code, so columns in this table are rows in sqlite3, as seen in this image. </p>

							<p>This had some issues when efforts to actually make this began, however. This was because it became clear from reading the sqlite3 documentation on generated fields that it was not obvious how to have fields scale with the size of a different table (although after I started work on the draft of the demonstration, I realized how this could be done) </p>

							<p>The potential complexity of what I had initially planned was dawning on me at this point so I set out to design a .db scheme that I could follow through on at my current skill level. The concept of an unlimited number of tag columns was dropped, and the automatic generation of “unique message ID”, and “tag ID” auto-generation was also dropped. The plan now, was to use “perfect” input files that already had the necessary information to populate a tag ID field. </p>

							<p>These are the files that I ended up with: </p>

							<p>The first integer is the tag_ID this is magically made consistent across the two files in this draft of the artifact. The second string is the author, next is the time (it's called date in the table), and finally the content of the message. </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg2.PNG" width="500">

							<br>

							<img src="images/dataimg3.PNG" width="500">

							<p>Once the basic structure, and the reading of the files was created, the next step was to add functions for searching the snippets table based off tags from the tag table. </p>

							<p>These are the functions that made the tables and read in the files: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg4.PNG" width="500">
							
							<br>

							<img src="images/dataimg5.PNG" width="500">
							
							<br>

							<img src="images/dataimg6.PNG" width="500">
							
							<br>

							<p>At this point, I started work on the functions required to find the tag_ID based of a user entered search for a tag_description. The function would then need to return that tag_ID to the function that selected the snippet table rows associated with that tag_ID. </p>

							<p>This took me more time to figure out than the entirety of the work, up until this point there were three main problems. </p>

							<p>I will call this the saga of the NONE error, so called because I didn’t get an error, I just got NONE: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg7.PNG" width="500">

							<p>*This happened because when row was supposed to be returned to the print statement, instead what was returned was an empty list (some of the time it wasn’t empty, but none the less “NONE” still haunted me) </p>
							<br>

							<p>The first problem was that (stupidly), when I copied the functions that read in the files, I left the name the same, this meant that when they were called by this function below, the 1st file got read into both tables then the second file got read into both tables. Somehow this happened without producing errors, and since all the relevant information I was searching for was in the right table, I didn’t notice this hilarious mistake until I was about 5h into troubleshooting the 2nd problem. </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg8.PNG" width="500">
							<p>*(Instead of “read_snippets()” and “read_tags()” it was just “read ()” at this point) </p>

							<br>

							<p>The second problem was that I needed to compare the user entered search term to a text contained in the tag_description column I tried to use the format in this example code: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg9.PNG" width="500">

							<p>But for whatever reason this would not work. I spent a whole day trying different syntaxes, reading the documentations, looking at stack exchange, trying external functions to compare them... I couldn’t make it work. And during all this a discovered a plethora of other issues in my code, problem one for starters. But also, numerous logical stupidities in code that hasn’t been shown here, and mercifully doesn’t exist anymore, as well as problem three. </p>

							<p>The solution that eventually worked was using the same insert syntax that I’d used in the read() functions, that being this format: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg10.PNG" width="500">

							<p>Where the variables are inserted into place holders. But this format by itself, didn’t work, I still was greeted with my cold unfeeling nemesis ”“. a massive breakthrough was made however, and it was finding out that putting a comma after the variable insert was what converted it to a tuple, and it needs to be a tuple in order to take the place of “(?)”. You’ll see in the solution below that this was implemented. Eventually what worked was completely comparting the function, into this: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg11.PNG" width="500">

							<p>I have no idea why this works, something about (sql_,par_) concatenating it differently, I have no clue, theoretically it's the same as what I was doing earlier. Perhaps it was a combination of all the other problems I solved that led to this success. </p>

							<br>

							<p>Problem three may have already been noticed by the experienced reader, and that was that there were spaces between the commas in my sample files. This meant that all that time I spent searching for the snippet associated with “conversation one” I should have searched for “conversation one”. This would have been more apparent if there wasn’t a separate issue that I thought was causing the “NONE” </p>

							<br>

							<p>Problem four was that “fetchall()” returns a list, this was problematic because as the tag_ID gets passed around functions, and converted from a list to a tuple, to a list, it quickly turns into a mess of brackets, as seen here: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg12.PNG" width="500">

							<p>This was solved by passing the 1st item of the list returned by fetchall() instead of the whole list as seen here: </p>

							<img src="images/dataimg13.PNG" width="500">

							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h3>Splitting the file up</h3>
							<p>While I was working through all those issues, I got sick of having to delete the .db before starting the program again to test a change, so split my work into two program files, one that made the .db, and read in the sample data, and another that did this little tag search that was causing me so much grief. </p>

Goblin will be a Python based application that text is pasted into, allowing for “retro-active” recording of text history.  

									The point of Goblin is to allow the user to manage small to medium sized chat histories so that they can be organized, searched, and posted on different services.  
									
									Goblin will be an application with some minimal UI a text box, the Idea is that the user selects all the relevant channel history and copy pastes it into the text box (hence the name, Goblin gobbles the text you put IN). The application then separates the wall of text into individual messages and records the name of the user who posted the message, the time stamp on the message, and the content of the message. Those messages will form a “snapshot” which can then be saved to an existing history or saved as a new history. 
									
									The aim is to make it easy to store all of one’s chat histories so that they can be searched on and organized, so that it can be easily moved to different platforms or simply saved for later.”  </p>

									The point of Goblin is to allow the user to manage small to medium sized chat histories so that they can be organized, searched, and posted on different services.  
									
									Goblin will be an application with some minimal UI a text box, the Idea is that the user selects all the relevant channel history and copy pastes it into the text box (hence the name, Goblin gobbles the text you put IN). The application then separates the wall of text into individual messages and records the name of the user who posted the message, the time stamp on the message, and the content of the message. Those messages will form a “snapshot” which can then be saved to an existing history or saved as a new history.

								<p>As Goblin is a Python based application, Python’s language will be required to develop this project. Programs like Microsoft Visual Studio & Notepad++ will be utilised to code the application using Python language.  </p>

								<p>Goblin’s entry plan is to be a local based application, this means that the information will be stored on the users’ local machine (PC, MacOS, Linux etc). However, cloud-based servers & storage could be projected to be used in Goblin’s later service life. </p>

								<p>
									Group wise, we utilised Discord, GitHub, MS Visual Studio Code and Office365.
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Discord was utilised for the purpose of a general chat group, as we had difficulties with the notification system on MS Teams.
								</p>
								<p>
									GitHub was utilised for committing changes to the website. This function was used for multiple reasons, as the group had two members working on the website at the same time. It allowed the group to track progression but also created backups to the website coding. This is advantageous for diagnosing errors in coding, as committing changes frequently. 
								</p>
								<p> In Assignment Two, we had to commit hundreds of changes as we editted the template to our liking. With Assignment Three, information was changed as required, which reduced the amount of 'commits' required to keep a secure trail. </p>
								<p>
									MS Visual Studio code was the program we utilised for creating and editing code. This program also has a build in function to commit changes to GitHub.
								</p>
								<p>
									Office365 was utilised for creating and editing text documents. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, this allowed the group to collaborate virtually with freedom and ease, allowing all of us to share inputs and ideas at any given time.

								<h1> Group Reflection - Adam</h1>
								<p>Working on projects as a group is something I have never personally been involved with previously. I’ve been able to learn many things as we’ve progressed closer to the due date of the second assignment, an example being how important communication from all team members is. Good communication practices are essential for the assignment to be completed successfully and within the rubric as we aim for high scores. </p>

								<h3>What went well?</h3>
								<p>The organizational skills of the group really stood out. Lachlan and Courtenay had such a fantastic understanding of how the assignment was to be structured from the very beginning, which was extremely helpful for the rest of the group members who may not have had such a clear picture early on, like myself. </p>

								<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
								<p>The only thing I think can be improved is all team members' ability to attend our MS Teams meetings. The main problem was time zones and scheduling conflicts, which should be considered to be entirely out of our own control, as that is what sometimes happens when working in groups, particularly virtually. Hopefully going further into the Introduction to Information Technology course at RMIT, we’ll be able to list our schedules and organize dates with little to no hassle.  </p>

								<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
								<p>Teamwork.  

									Reading into our individual team profiles which documented our personality tests, it showed the majority of the group being considered as “introverted”. It surprised me how easy going, down to earth and the way the group was able to gel and work together as a team.  </p>
								
								<h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>
								<p>Time frames and deadlines. 

									As the assignment due date drew closer, it became apparent that a little bit of panic was starting to set across the group. Having time frames and deadlines for our personal work in the group has the ability to set up everything else remaining to be completed. </p>
								
								<h1>Group Reflection - Declan</h1>

								<p>Group work requires a lot of communication, luckily ours were already familiar with discord which we used to communicate more than scheduled meetings. Unfortunately, I ran into many issues attending meetings since they all fell around my work schedule, and I was not aware of a time difference between me and the group. I tried attending all scheduled meetings even arounds times, but I also had meetings with work IRL. Most of my contribution was answered in discord after watching the meetings and writing answers to all questions the members would have asked.  </p>

								<h3>What went well?</h3>
								<p>I’ve got to give props to Lachlan for breaking down the assessment pdf and distributing us all onto our tasks to spread out equally. He maintained this throughout the whole thing. Courtney for also understanding it which helped me out since breaking down assessment criteria's is not my strong suit. We shared a raw text file which everyone had access to and kept communicating through discord since it was easier to access than Microsoft teams since most of us were not use to it. I went through and organized everything since I have trouble with messy stuff and made lists so we could check out what needed to be done and what had not, this made it easier for me to work at my best. </p>

								<h3>What could be improved?</h3>
								<p>Meetings were a big problem, luckily, we kept communication up on discord since this was easier in this regard. Everyone could just view the message and reply at their own times and a fluctuation in times can be seen with people having different work schedules and others being busy at times where others aren't. We have improvised solutions for the future to table what days we will struggle to be free. </p>

								<h3>At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
								<p>Being online it is hard to have a good relationship with individuals you just met yet we all seem to just click, everyone slowly but surely ended up being able to just talk which took me by surprise since I have trouble with that, but I do find it easier since it is online, and it feels easier instead of meeting face to face wish I reckon would have gone to shambles. So, this could not have worked out better since it was online.  </p>

								<h3>At least one thing you have learned about groups?</h3>
								<p>Communication, 

									As the due date drew closer, we really needed to update each other on who can help what and workload share between members. We all talked more towards the end than at the start since a little bit of panic was introduced, eventually we have a good understanding so we can get it done quickly. I am proud of myself since I tend to struggle in group activities, but this group has been good.  </p>
